# Cosmic-Phenomena-Identification-Distributed-Computing
This repository contains the code and documentation for a distributed computing analysis conducted for identifying high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies from spectral files. The project was undertaken as part of Statistics 405 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in collaboration with the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC).
